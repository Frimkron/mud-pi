{
    "name" : [NAME]
    "frequency" : [FREQUENCY]
    "path" : [PATH]
}
notes:
[NAME]
the classname of the desired import, it should be defined in the script file
(this will be executed as, "from scriptname import classname")

[FREQUENCY]
the relative frequency of players becoming this class
can be float or int
Probability that the player becomes this class is equal to
frequency / the summation of all other class frequencies

So if frequencies are Dog:1, Bird:3, Cat:6
the summation = 10
the probability of spawning as a Dog = 1 / 10
This field is optional

[PATH]
the path to the script, assuming that it is called from the
highest folder in the git repository (i.e. the one containing
"scripts", "locations", "chars", etc.)
